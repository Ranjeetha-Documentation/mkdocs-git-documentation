# HAL

The HAL Layer(Hardware Abstraction Layer) plays a vital role in facilitating communication between the video application software and hardware components like the GPU, video encoding/decoding hardware, and audio devices. It provides a standardized framework for functions, data structures, and protocols, enabling efficient hardware resource utilization. The HAL layer manages
**hardware initialization**
,
**memory allocation**
,
**input/output operations**
, and
**hardware-specific events**
, shielding software developers from hardware complexities and allowing them to prioritize user experience and functionality.

RDK provides a set of HAL APIs that abstract the platform from RDK. Vendors need to implement the HAL APIs to meet the HAL Specifications. With the help of the HAL API Specification for different RDK Components, vendors can successfully port RDK to their platform. Depending on the device profile

,

,
[Hybrid STB](https://wiki.rdkcentral.com/display/RDK/RDKV+Hybrid)
etc. ), vendors may choose the relevant components and perform the port by implementing the HAL layer. Detailed information about vendor porting guide will be available soon.

## SOC

The System on Chip (SOC) Layer forms the foundational interface between hardware components, ensuring system security and reliability. It incorporates various crucial elements such as
**DRM Libraries ,**
which
manages digital rights and secure content delivery to prevent unauthorized access and distribution.
**Trusted Applications (Apps TA)**
guarantee the secure execution of sensitive operations and protect critical data from unauthorized access. The
**Secure Store**
oversees the storage of DRM keys and Apps triplets, maintaining the confidentiality and integrity of vital data. Additionally,
**MFR Libraries**
manage hardware functionality, providing access to specific hardware features and capabilities, thereby contributing to the overall security and functionality of the system.

# Application Scenario

Consider the use case of a user accessing a streaming application like Youtube on an RDK Video-supported device. The user interacts with the application through the Application Layer, selecting content and initiating playback. The Application Platform Layer, utilizing the Firebolt
®
and Lightning™ frameworks, manages the user interface and application lifecycle.
The RDK Layer ensures seamless communication between the application and the hardware, managing services, cryptographic operations, inter-component communication, window management, and content decryption through OpenCDM.
The RDK HAL Layer then utilizes the Gstreamer media pipeline to decode and render the video content, ensuring a smooth and high-quality viewing experience.
Finally, the SOC Layer provides a secure environment for the entire system, safeguarding the hardware, managing DRM policies, and securing sensitive data, ensuring a secure and reliable video streaming experience for the user.
